## Types of load balancer on AWS

- AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers
	**- Classic Load Balancer (vI - old generation) - 2009 - CLB**
		• HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
	**- Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) — 2016 - ALB**
		• HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
	**- Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2017 - NLB**
		• TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
	**- Gateway Load Balancer — 2020 - GWLB**
		• Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol
- Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they
provide more features
- Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs


## Application Load Balancer (V2)

-  Routing tables to different target groups:
-  Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
-  Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
- Routing based on Query String, Headers
(example.com/users?id=|23&order=false)
- ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
- In comparison, we'd need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application

### Sticky Sessions (Session Affinitity)

![[CleanShot 2024-07-04 at 22.28.21@2x.png]]
- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the
**same client is always redirected to the same**
**instance** behind a load balancer
- This works for **Classic Load Balancer**, **Application**
**Load Balancer**, and **Network Load Balancer**
- The *"cookie"* used for stickiness has an
expiration date you control
- **Use case:** make sure the user doesn't lose his
session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances
### Cross-Zone Load Balancing

![[CleanShot 2024-07-04 at 22.36.58@2x.png]]
- **Application Load Balancer**
	- Enabled by default (can be disabled at the Target Group level)
	- No charges for inter AZ data
- **Network Load Balancer & Gateway Load Balancer**
	- Disabled by default
	- You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled
-  **Classic Load Balancer**
	- Disabled by default
	- No charges for inter AZ data if enabled
## Network Load Balancer (v2)

- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
	- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
	- Handle millions of request per seconds
	- Less latency ~ 100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)

- NLB has **one static IP per AZ**, and supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
-  NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
-  Not included in the AWS free tier
- **Target groups:** 
	- EC2 Instances
	- IP Addresses
	- Application Load Balancer
	- Heal Checks support the TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols

## Gateway Load Balancer

- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party
network virtual appliances in AWS
- Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection
Systems, payload manipulation, ...
- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) - IP Packets
- Combines the following functions:
	- **Transparent Network Gateway** - single entry/exit for all traffic
	- **Load Balancer** - distributes traffic to your virtual appliances
- Uses the GENEVE protocol on port **6081**
- **Target groups:**
	- EC2 instance
	- IP Address - must be private IPs

# SSL/TLS Basic

- An SSL Certificate allows traffic between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- **SSL** refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections
- **TLS** refers to Transport Layer Security, which is a newer version
- Nowadays, **TLS certificates are mainly used,** but people still refer as SSL
- Public SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CA)
- Comodo, Symantec, GoDaddy, GlobalSign, Digicert, Letsencrypt, etc....
- SSL certificates have an expiration date (you set) and must be renewed

## SSL Certificates

![[CleanShot 2024-07-04 at 22.44.32@2x.png]]


- The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
- You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
- You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
-  HTTPS listener:
	- You must specify a default certificate
	- You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
	- **Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach**
	- Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL /TLS (legacy clients)


## SNI - Server Name Indication

- SNI solves the problem of loading multiple SSL
certificates onto one web server (to serve
multiple websites)
- It's a "newer" protocol, and requires the client
to indicate the hostname of the target server in the initial SSL handshake
- The server will then find the correct
certificate, or return the default one

**Note:**
- Only works for ALB & NLB (newer
generation), CloudFront
- Does not work for CLB (older gen)

## ELB - SSL Certificates

- **Classic Load Balancer (vI)**
	- Support only one SSL certificate
	- Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates

-  **Application Load Balancer (V2)**
	- Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
	- Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work

- **Network Load Balancer (v2)**
	-  Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
