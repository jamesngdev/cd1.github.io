# What is DNS

# Amazon Route 53

• A - maps a hostname to IPv4
• AAAA - maps a hostname to IPv6
• CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname
	• The target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record
	• Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone
	Арех)
• Example: you can't create for example.com, but you can create for
www.example.com
• NS - Name Servers for the Hosted Zone
• Control how traffic is routed for a domain

### Route 53 - Hosted Zones


- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains
	- **Public Hosted Zones** — contains records that specify how to route traffic on the Internet (public domain names) *applicationI.mypublicdomain.com*
	- **Private Hosted Zones** — contain records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs (private domain names) *application I .company.internal*

### Route 53 - Alias Records Targets

Alias Records can connect to ROOT Domain

- Elastic Load Balancers
- CloudFront Distributions
- API Gateway
- Elastic Beanstalk environments
- S3 Websites
- VPC Interface Endpoints
- Global Accelerator accelerator
- Route 53 record in the same hosted zone
- You cannot set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name. 

### Route 53 - Routing Policies

- Define how Route 53 responds to DNS queries
- Don't get confused by the word "*Routing"*
	- It's not the same as Load balancer routing which routes the traffic
	- DNS does not route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS queries
- Route 53 Supports the following Routing Policies
	- Simple
	- Weighted
	- Failover
	- Latency based
	- Geolocation
	- Multi-Value Answer
	- Geoproximity (using Route 53 Traffic Flow feature)
