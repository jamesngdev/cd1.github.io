# What's an EBS Volume? 


- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run. 
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level).
- They are bound to a specific availability zone.
- **Analogy:** Think of them as a "network USD stick"

# EBS Volume

- It's a network driver
	- it uses the network to communicate, which means there might be a bit of latency
	- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly.
- It's locked by an Availability Zone ( AZ )
	- An EBS volume in us-east-a cannot to attached to us-east-1b
	- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it. 
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPs)


# EBS Volumes Types

• EBS Volumes come in 6 types
	**• gp2 / gp3 (SSD):** General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for
	a wide variety of workloads
	• **iol / io2 Block Express (SSD)**: Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical
	low-latency or high-throughput workloads
	• **stl (HDD):** Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput- intensive workloads
	• **scl (HDD):** Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads

• EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (1/O Ops Per Sec)
• When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation — it's good!
• Only gp2/gp3 and io I/io2 Block Express can be used as boot volumes


## General Purpose SSD

- Cost effective storage, low-latency
- System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
- I GiB - 16 TiB
- gp3:
	- Baseline of 3,000 lOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
	- Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently
• gp2:
	-Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
	- Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
	- 31OPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at the max IOPS
## Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD

- Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
- Or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
- Great for **databases workloads** (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
- io l (4 GiB - 16 TiB):
	- Max PIOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other
	- Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
- i02 Block Express (4 GiB - 64 TiB):
	- Sub-millisecond latency
	-  Max PIOPS: 256,000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1,000:1
- **Support EBS Multi-attach** 

## Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

- Cannot be a boot volume
- 125 GB -> 16TB
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st l )
	- Big Data, Data warehouses, Log Processing
	- Max throughput 500 Mb/s - max IOPS 500
- Cold HDD (scl)
	- For data that is infrequently accessed
	- Scenarios where lowest cost is important
	- Max throughput 250 MiB/s - max IOPS 250


# EBS Multi-Attach - io I / io2 family

- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2
instances in the same AZ
- Each instance has full read & write permissions
to the high-performance volume
- **Use case:**
	- Achieve higher application availability in clustered
	Linux applications (ex: Teradata)
	- Applications must manage concurrent write
	operations
- **Up to 16 EC2 Instances** at a time
- Must use a file system that's cluster-aware (not
XFS, EXT4, etc....)


# EBS Encryption

- When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following:
	-  Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
	- All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
	- All snapshots are encrypted
	- All volumes created from the snapshot
- Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
- Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted

**Encryption: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume**
- Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
- Encrypt the EBS snapshot ( using copy )
- Create new ebs volume from the snapshot ( the volume will also be encrypted)
- Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance
