EC2 = Elastic compute cloud = Infrastructure as a Service

**Consists in the capability of:** 
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

**EC2 sizing & configuration options:**
- OS: Lunix, Windows or MacOS
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage space: 
	- Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	- hardware (EC2 instance store)
- Network card: speed of the card. Public IP Address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

 **EC2 User Data**
 - bootstrap means lunching command when a machine starts
 - only run once in first start.
 - runs with the root user



# EC2 Instance Types

See more: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

### Naming convention 

**m5.2xlarge**
- m: instance class
- 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class

### Compute Optimized

**High performance processors:**  (Choose the C types, example: C5, C6,...)
- Batch processing workloads
- Media transcoding
- High performance web servers
- High performance computing (HPC)
- Scientific modeling & machine learning
- Dedicated gaming servers

**Memory optimized** ( Choose R) : Fast performance of workloads that process large data set in memory
- High performance, relational/non relational databases. 
- Distributed web scale cache stores.
- In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence).
- Applications performing real time processing of bigs unstructured data.

**Storage optimized**
- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
- Relational & NoSQL databases
- Cache for in-memory databases.

# Security groups

- Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances.
- Only contain #allows rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group.

### Good to know
- One security group can be attached to multiple instances
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it. 
- It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
- If your application is not accessible (timeout) -> Check security group.
- If app gives a "connection refused" error -> application error or not launched. 
- All inbound traffic is **blocked** by default.
- All outbound traffic is **authorised** by default.

### Classic Ports
- 22 = SSH 
- 21 = FTP
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP
- 443 = HTTPS


# Purchasing Options

**One-Demand Instances**
- short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
**Reserved (1 & 3 years)**
-  Reserved Instances - long workloads
- Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances.
**Saving Plans ( 1- 3 years)** 
-  Commitment to and amount of usage, long workload
**Spot Instances:**
- short workloads, cheap , can lose instances (less reliable)
**Dedicated Hosts:**
- book an entire physical server, control instance placement
**Dedicated Instances**
- no other customers will be your hardware
**Capacity Reservations**
- reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration


## EC2 On Demand

- Pay for what you use
	- Lunix or Window - billing per second, after the first minute.
	- All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment.
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads. Where you can't predict how the application will behave.
## Reserved (1 & 3 years)

- Up to 72% discount to On-demand
- You reverse a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- Reservation Period
	- 1 year (+ discount)
	- 3 years ( ++ discount)
- Payment options:
	- No upfront (+)
	- Partial Upfront (++)
	- All Upfront (+++)
- Reserved Instance's Scope:
	- Regional 
	- Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think databases)

## Saving Plans

- Get discount based on long term usage ( up  to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10 hours for 1 or 3 years).
- Usage beyond EC2 Saving Plans is billed at the On-Demand price.
- Locked to specific instance family & AWS region (M5 in us-east-I)
- Flexible across:
	- Instance type
	- OS
	- Tenacy
## Spot Instances
- Discount of 90% compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The **MOST  cost-efficient** instances in AWS
- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure:
	- Batch jobs
	- Data analysis
	- Image processing
	- Any **distributed** workloads
	- Workloads with a flexible start and end time
# Dedicated Hosts

- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
- Allows you **address compliance requirements** and use your existing server - bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, per-VM software licenses).
- Purchasing Options:
	- On-Demand: pay per seconds for active Dedicated host
	- Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No upfront, partial upfront, all upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL - Bring your own license).


# Dedicated Instances

- Instances run on hardware that's dedicated to you 
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

## Capacity Reservations

- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration.
- You
