# Private vs Public IP (IPv4)

- Networking has two sorts of IPS: 
	- IP4: 12.412.412.213
	- IP6: 3ffe:1900:445324:3:200:f8f8f:67cf
- IPv4 is still the most common format used online.
- IPv6 is newer and solves problems for the IoT.
- IPv4 allows for 3.7 billion different addresses in the public space.


# Elastic IPs

- When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP.
- If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP.
- AN Elastic IP is a public IPv6 you own long as you don't delete it.
- You can attach it to **one instance at a time.**
- You can only have **05 Elastic IP** in your account
- Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP:
	- They often reflect poor architectural decisons.
	- Instead, use a random public IP and register a **DNS name** to it. 
	- Or, as we'll see later, use a **Load Balancer** and don't use a public IP.


# Placement Groups

- Control over EC2 instance placement strategy
- When you create a new placement group, you specify one of following strategies for the group:
	- **Cluster:** cluster instances into a low-latency group in single Availbility Zone
	- **Spread:** spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) - critical applications
	- **Partition:** spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of rack) within AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Haddop, Cassandra, Kafka)

# ENI: Elastic Network Interfaces 

- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
- The ENI can have the following attributes: 
	- Primary private IPv6, one or more secondary IPv6
	- One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
	- One Public IPv4
	- One or more security groups
	- A MAC Address
- You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover.
- Bound of ENI is AZ
