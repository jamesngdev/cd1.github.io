### Overview

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
	- Postgres
	- MySQL
	- MariaDB
	-  Oracle
	- Microsoft SQL Server
	-  IBM DB2
	- Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

### Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

• RDS is a managed service:
	• Automated provisioning, OS patching
	• Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
	• Monitoring dashboards
	• Read replicas for improved read performance
	• Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
	• Maintenance windows for upgrades
	• Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
	• Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io 1)
• BUT you can't SSH into your instances


### RDS - Storage Auto Scaling

- Help you increase storage of RBD DB instance dynamically.
- When RBS detects you are running out of free storage, it scales automatically.
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage.
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatic modify storage if:
	- Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage.
	- Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes.
	- 6 hours have passed since last modification. 
- Useful for application with **unpredictable workloads**
- Supports all RBS database engines


### RBS - Read Replicas vs Multi AZ

**Replicas**
- Up to 15 Read Replicas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ, or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent.
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
- Application must be update connection string to leverage read replicas.
- Read Replicas only use for SELECT (read) - can't do any actions likes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

**MutilAZ**:
- Automatic fail over	
- Protect database performance
- Enhance durability	
- Increase availability 
- Use Amazon RDS Multi-AZ synchronous replication technologies to keep data on your standby database instance up to date with the primary.

### RBS - Network Cost

- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another..
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee.

### Disaster Recovery

- SYNC replication 
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to stand by
- Increase availability.
- Failover in case loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure.
- No manual intervention in apps.
- Not used for scaling

**Note:** The read replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

### Amazon Aurora

-  Automatic fail-over
-  Backup and Recovery
-  Isolation and security
-  Industry compliance
-  Push-button scaling
- Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
-  Advanced Monitoring
- Routine Maintenance
-  Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups

**Aurora Custom Endpoint**

**Aurora Serverless**

**Global Aurora**
- **Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas**
	- Useful for disaster recovery
	- Simple to put in place
- **Aurora Global Database (recommended)**
	- 01 Primary Region (read/write)
	- Up to 05 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second.
	- Up to 16 seconds replicas per secondary region
	- Helps for decreasing latency
	- Promoting another region ( for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
	- **Typical cross-region replication takes less than 1 second.**

**Aurora Machine Learning**
- Enables you to add ML-based predictions to
your applications via SQL
- Simple, optimized, and secure integration
between Aurora and AWS ML services
- Supported services
- Amazon SageMaker (use with any ML model)
-  Amazon Comprehend (for sentiment analysis)
- You don't need to have ML experience
- Use cases: fraud detection, ads targeting,
sentiment analysis, product recommendations


### RDS Backup

- Automated backups:
	- Daily full backup of the database (during the backup window)
	- Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
	- => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
	- I to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
- Manual DB Snapshots
	- Manually triggered by the user
	- Retention of backup for as long as you want

- **Trick:** in a stopped RDS database, you will ***still pay for storage***. If you plan on stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot & restore instead

### Aurora Backup

- Automated backups
	- 1 to 35 days (cannot be disabled)
	- point-in-time recovery in that timeframe
- Manual DB Snapshots
	- Manually triggered by the user


### RDS & Aurora Restore options

- **Restoring a RDS / Aurora backup or a snapshot** creates a new database

- **Restoring MySQL RDS database from S3**
	- Create a backup of your on-premises database
	- Store it on Amazon 53 (object storage)
	- Restore the backup file onto a new RDS instance running MySQL Amazon RDS

- **Restoring MySQL Aurora cluster from S3**
	- reate a backup of your on-premises database using Percona XtraBackup
	- Store the backup file on Amazon S3
	- Restore the backup file onto a new Aurora cluster running MySQL Amazon Aurora_
